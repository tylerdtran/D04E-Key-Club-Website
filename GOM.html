                            <p>“Being the first introduced to her through her DLT interview, I could see that
                                although shy, she demonstrated an eagerness to grow and learn. As a club
                                secretary, she continues to work hard and is constantly revising anything that she
                                can, so that she is able to display only her best work. Her work with the MRF is
                                unremarkably integral to the success of her home club, and I see a bright future
                                ahead of her within her Key Club journey. As an EA, she is growing to speak more
                                and be more confident in her own abilities. I am super proud of her progress and
                                can’t wait to see more from her.” </br>- Lieutenant Governor Vincent Vu</p>
