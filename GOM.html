                                offer a lot of ideas and growth to
                                her own home club and the
                                Division. As a member, I want to
                                continue seeing her attend events
                                and growing both in service and
                                spirit for this club! She has the
                                potential to really make a
                                difference, and I can’t wait to see
                                what she does as a Spirit Team
                                Member this year.”

                                can, so that she is able to display only her best work. Her work with the MRF is
                                unremarkably integral to the success of her home club, and I see a bright future
                                ahead of her within her Key Club journey. As an EA, she is growing to speak more
