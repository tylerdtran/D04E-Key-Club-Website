# DO4E Key Club Website
This was my first ever website I built when I was a Senior in High School. I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create the site. The site 
utilized modern Front-End Web Development concepts such as Flex Box, Dynamic Sizing to accomodate various device sizes/types. 

Technologies Used 
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

To run the website, run the command 
```
git clone 
```
Then ```cd``` into the D04E-Key-Club-Website Directory using the command 
```
cd D04E-Key-Club-Website
```
Lastly run the website by opening the index.html file to visit the home page of the website.
